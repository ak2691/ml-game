# Frontend context

Use this map for React, browser networking, deterministic brain editing, arena
training, Pixi rendering, and replay presentation. For arena internals, continue
to [`src/beta/context.md`](src/beta/context.md).

## Entry points and routes

- `src/main.jsx`: mounts React.
- `src/App.jsx`: route ownership and lazy-loaded pages.
- `src/routeLoaders.js`: route-level loading helpers.
- `src/pages/`: login, registration, home, and matchmaking screens.
- `src/auth/`: session state and route protection.
- `src/security/csrf.js`: CSRF acquisition/header helpers for state changes.
- `src/index.css` and `src/App.css`: global/application styling.

Route UI and navigation bugs here first. Authentication behavior usually spans
`auth/`, `security/`, the calling page, and server auth/security endpoints.

## Task routing

| Concern | Primary paths | Also inspect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App route or page UI | `src/pages/` and the app shell | relevant styles and route-loading area |
| Login/session/CSRF | `src/auth/`, `src/security/` | server auth/security areas |
| Matchmaking lifecycle/draft/object placement | `src/pages/`, `src/matchmaking/` | server matchmaking areas |
| WebSocket framing/reconnect | `src/matchmaking/` | server WebSocket configuration and controller areas |
| Logic evaluation/normalization | `src/logic/` | nearby tests and arena payload/loadout contracts |
| Movement planning | `src/logic/` | arena geometry and constants areas |
| Submission/training-session API | `src/logic/` API boundary modules | server DTO, controller, validation, and service areas |
| Arena, combat, loadout, Pixi | [`src/beta/context.md`](src/beta/context.md) | relevant docs via `docs/context.md` |
| Authoritative replay display | `src/replay/` | arena presentation and server replay DTO areas |

## Logic and API boundaries

`src/logic/` owns the structured brain contract and deterministic browser-side
selection/planning helpers. Keep schema normalization pure and bounded. Stable
action, target, condition, comparator, and ability IDs must match server
validation and simulation.

`SubmissionClient.js` sends normalized brain/loadout data; it does not make the
browser authoritative. Any payload change requires tracing the matching server
DTO, validator, persistence mapping, and rated simulation consumer.

The WebSocket client uses STOMP destinations under `/app/matchmaking.*` and
receives user events from `/user/queue/matchmaking`. Treat destination or event
shape changes as shared contracts.

## Arena boundary

`src/beta/BetaModel.jsx` is the browser training orchestrator and
`src/beta/PixiCanvas.jsx` presents arena state. Do not add gameplay authority to
the renderer. The focused arena context maps combat, ECS, payload, loadout, and
visual-state ownership.

## Checks

Run the narrowest matching test first:

- brain/conditions/targeting: `src/logic/BotBrain.test.js`;
- movement: `src/logic/MovementActions.test.js`;
- entity/combat execution: `src/beta/ecs/EntitySystems.test.js`;
- interpolation/visual mapping: `src/beta/pixi/*.test.js`.

Then use `npm test`. For UI, import, or build changes also run `npm run lint` and
`npm run build`.

Do not inspect or modify `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `*.log`, or generated Vite
assets as source.
